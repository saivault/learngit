# Git

How would you manage changes in a project ?

Let's say we have a project, and at any moment you want to go back to some other versions of that project, where that project was actually in the working stage, then we can use something known as Version Control System(VCS). And the most popular version control system is called git. What VCS does can be explained in two phrases (tracking files, managing changes). 


### Version Control System 
How this VCS is able to recover those files from various versions ?

- Version Control is a management software responsible for managing changes to computer programs, documents, large websites, or other collections of information.
- Easy recovery of files/folders.
- Rollback to the previous versions
- Informs us about who, what, when, why changes have been made.
